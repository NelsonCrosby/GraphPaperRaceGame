        Graph Paper Race Game (GPRG) is based off of a game traditionally played on grid
        paper (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racetrack_%28game%29">Wikipedia</a>
        page). A track is drawn on a grid. A starting line is determined, and a number
        of 'vehicles' are drawn at this line. Vehicles move in turn. Each turn, a vehicle
        may accelerate or decelerate by -1, 0 or 1 M/s
        (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan-units</a> per
        second), on each axis independently. The goal is to be the first to the finish line
        (which may also be the starting line in a circuit).

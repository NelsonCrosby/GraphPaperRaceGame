Woohoo - the first milestone of GPRG has been achieved!

 release notes:

> This is the game in its most basic form.
>
> Issues resolved:
>
> - [#2]\: Create a distributable standalone jar
> - [#3]\: Option to restart on death
> - [#4]\: Winning the game
> - [#5]\: Acceleration-based movement
> - [#6]\: Basic track selection
> - [#8]\: Track file header doesn't work correctly
> - [#10]\: Player can skip outside of track
> - [#12]\: Starting on the wrong side of the line
>
> Known issues:
>
> - [#1]\: Having no start line causes crash
>     - Not a problem unless you start modifying the `.track` files provided in the JAR (which you are limited to for the time being).
> - [#9]\: (Linux-only) Switching windows crashes game
>     - An issue with LWJGL and X, not something we can fix unfortunately.
> - [#11]\: (Mac-only) Natives not correctly resolving
>     - [Here's a manual fix](https://github.com/NelsonCrosby/GraphPaperRaceGame/issues/11#issuecomment-66754937) you can try if the game crashes immediately.
>     - This should be resolved by the next pre-release.

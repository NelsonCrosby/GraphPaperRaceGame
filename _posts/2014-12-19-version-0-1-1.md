[Pre-Release 1 Update 1](https://github.com/NelsonCrosby/GraphPaperRaceGame/releases/tag/v0.1.1)
 release notes:

> Fixed a probable future issue with .track format.
>
> **NOTE:** Tracks created for this version are completely incompatible with tracks created for the previous version - the behaviour is undefined. Future versions will have defined behaviour for incompatible tracks, however this version marks the boundary between two different versioning formats, and the track compatibility behaviour is undefined.
>
>
> Issues resolved:
>
> - [#15]\: Problem with current .track format
>
> Known issues:
>
> - [#1]\: Having no start line causes crash
>   - Not a problem unless you start modifying the `.track` files provided in the JAR (which you are limited to for the time being).
> - [#9]\: (Linux-only) Switching windows crashes game
>   - An issue with LWJGL and X, not something we can fix unfortunately.
> - [#11]\: (Mac-only) Natives not correctly resolving
>   - [Here's a manual fix](https://github.com/NelsonCrosby/GraphPaperRaceGame/issues/11#issuecomment-66754937) you can try if the game crashes immediately.
>   - This should be resolved by the next pre-release.
